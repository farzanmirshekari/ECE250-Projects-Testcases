<h1>ECE250-Projects-Testcases</h1>

This repository contains testcases for ECE250 (Data Structures & Algorithms) projects. The repository is meant to be a collaborative effort. Commiting your own testcases to the repository is highly encouraged. This will benefit everyone as we can all make sure that our implementation is viable against a more comprehensive input set. Feel free to pull the repository and run your project code against the testcases available. For information on how to contribute, please read the instructions below.

<h3>Contributing</h3>

> This repository is maintained by myself (fmirshek@uwaterloo.ca) and hosted on my personal GitHub. In order to add new testcases, pull the repository, make your commits, and then open a pull request. The pull requests will be reviewed by Tristan Parry (tparry@uwaterloo.ca) or myself and upon approval, will be merged.

<h3>Formatting</h3>

> When creating new testcases, please add a comment at the end of your file (after the terminating command, usually <i>END</i> or <i>EXIT</i>) explaining what your testcase is evaluating. For instance, if you have written a test input for an edge case, add a comment explaining what the edge case is. This is recommended as it will help others understand your input better.
